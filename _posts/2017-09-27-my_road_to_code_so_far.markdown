Hi everyone! My name is Joma Ejercito. Today marks my first month in the Flatiron School's Online Web Developer Program. I have been enjoying the course so far, and have just finished the HTML & CSS portion of the course. 

I graduated from Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University on May 2016, with a BS in Business Administration with a dual concentration in Information Systems and Marketing. It's a very long title, I know. I was first exposed to programming languages in my Information Systems classes at Fordham. I was able to learn the basics of Python and SQL. However, I forgot all of what I learned. Even though it's only been a year since I graduated. I decided to take these two courses because I thought they would compliment each other well and because they are both my passions. I love marketing, and I'm skilled at computers.

After graduation, I just wanted a job. Any job. I just wanted to be employed and get a jumpstart at my career. Ideally, I wanted a job in either Media or Public Relations. I was not able to find a job in either of those industries, which I was pretty sad about at that time. I got a job after one month of job hunting, as a Cash Office Associate in a retail company. That job involved a lot of multitasking, Excel work, organization, and dealing with plenty of people. It was a great job to practice being a good employee, however if I had known better and was patient, I would've either taken Computer Science or the full Information Systems degree in college, or have gone to a coding bootcamp straight after college. I am very grateful for the experience I had at my job and do not regret it, as it has helped me grow as a person and it helped me realize that I wanted to pursue coding.

Earlier this year, while I was at my job, I was thinking to myself, "Why am I here? My team and I do so much yet we are undervalued and underpaid". I wanted to leave. As I previously mentioned, I concentrated in Information Systems in college. So I thought, why not enhance that ability?! The Media and Public Relations industries are highly saturated and competitive, and the people I know that ended up working in those industries are not enjoying it. I started doing research on coding, coding bootcamps, what jobs are available to people with programming skills, and everything that has to do with how to learn coding.

I eventually quit my job and started learning JavaScript at codecademy.com. Then I took the JavaScript Jumpstart course as well as the Bootcamp Prep course of Fullstack Academy. I applied to several schools (but not Fullstack because I was too intimidated), and decided on Flatiron School. I initially applied for the Immersive course, but I was rejected. Although I was immediately offered the Online course, I was still feeling down. However, upon further research and talking to Annette, I decided to take the Online course because I really like the culture that Flatiron School has.

Coding is an invaluable skill to have, especially at this day and age. Everything is going digital: the way we communicate, the way we conduct research, the way we shop, and a lot more of the things we do. Everyone is dependent on their phones and laptops. I have been using technology since I was 3 years old (computers, cellphones, video games, you name it), and as someone who is surrounded by people who use technology constantly, I realized that I should pursue coding. Learning these languages and frameworks allow people to create things, and there are endless possibilities. There is an application, software, and website for almost everything. I would hope to one day create my own and feel like I am contributing to society.

I am currently starting the Procedural Ruby portion of the course. I am looking forward to mastering Ruby soon and getting to learn the other languages and frameworks. Until next time!
