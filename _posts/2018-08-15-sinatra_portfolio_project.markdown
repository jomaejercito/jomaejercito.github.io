I did it. After two agonizing weeks, I finally finished my Sinatra Portfolio Project! Initially, I tried to make an events tracker for different venues, in which a user has many venues, and venues have many events, and a user has many events through venues. I was working on this tirelessly for four days and could not get it to properly work. I was not even able to follow the RESTful Routes rules. After getting project support, I was advised to make the project simpler. I really wanted to go all out on this project since it is part of my portfolio, but I was advised that I can always go back to edit and fix it. 

At this point I was ready to give up. I even went to the Flatiron School campus hoping to ask admissions if there is a possibility for me to be placed in the upcoming immersive cohort. No one from admissions was there, so I went back home and collected myself. I started a new project, and after 7 hours, I miraculously created a project that works!

For my Sinatra Portfolio Project, I decided to create a Pokémon Team Builder. In this project, users can make different Pokémon teams and see the other teams that other users made. It can be used by people that wants to keep track of their Pokémon teams for competitive play, or anyone that just wants to create different fantasy Pokémon teams. This project was a lot simpler. A user has many teams and a team belongs to a user. 

In order to use this program, a user (which I wanted to call "Trainer", but didn't so I won't get too confused) needs to create an account by with a username, email, and password. An existing user can also log in by providing a username with a matching password. If the username and password do not match, a user cannot log in.

Once logged in, a user can create a Pokémon team, view their existing teams if they have any, and view teams created by other users. Once the user creates a team, they can view, edit, or delete their team. A user can see a list of teams created by other users, as well as a list of a particular user's teams. They can view the different teams, but cannot edit or delete them, as the "edit" and "delete" buttons are not available on other user's teams. 

So far, this app is extremely simple. I'm extremely happy I was able to get it to work. I will definitely go back to this project and use Bootstrap in order to make it look pretty, since I have an obsession with making things look pretty. I'm also hoping to add different features and functionalities so it will look more like a decent project with effort, as opposed to simply a functioning project. But for now, I'll settle with this.

This project can be accessed here: https://github.com/jomaejercito/pokemon-team-builder.

I'm excited to move forward onto the Rails unit and hopefully finish the program in a few months. I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was! Okay, maybe that was pushing it a little. But hey, dreams are free.
